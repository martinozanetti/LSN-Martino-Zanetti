    "Write a code to solve the TSP with a **Genetic** algorithm (GA). Note that you should invent **some** *genetic-mutation* operators and a *genetic-crossover* operator which should preserve the bonds of the problem: the salesman must visit one and only one time every city and must be back to the first city in the end of the path.\n",

Importante: funzione check: il \"cromosoma\" ha il vincolo di visitare tutti i punti e tornare al punto iniziale: il check deve controllare (ogni tanto?) che tutta la popolazione soddisfi il vincolo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data structure of your code is ready, before you start coding your genetic operators, I warmly suggest you to code the creation of the starting population and to code a **check function** that verifies if every *individual* fulfils the bonds. Then check your starting population ... and use your check function every time you create a new individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to invent also a **selection** operator. \n",

    "you have 2 possibilities:\n",
    "1. write a selection operator which obtain the probability to select an individual from $L^{(2)}(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\dots, \\vec{x}_N)$ or $L^{(1)}(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\dots, \\vec{x}_N)$\n",
    "2. write a selection operator which simply uses the order in the orderd population with $M$ individuals, e.g. select the individual $j$ with the algorithm: $j= int(M \\times r^p)+1$ where $r$ is a uniform random number $r\\in[0,1)$ and $p$ a convenient exponent. \n",

    "4. inversion of the order in which they appear in the path of $m$ cities (except for the first city and $m \\le N$), e.g. $\\left[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\right] \\to \\left[ 1, 4, 3, 2, 5 \\right]$ for the inversion of the cities from 2 to 4.\n",
